# PFNN for High Fidelity

This project is a work in progress - it doesn't work yet. 
The basic idea is to see if the PFNN can be adapted to run in HighFidelity using JavaScript. 
The C++ code is being translated into JavaScript. 
GLM-JS is being used for simpler translation of C++ glm functions.
Many thanks to HumbleTim and Fluffy Jenkins for their help so far.

## Tasks complete
* Analysed PFNN data files: Xmean, Xstd, Ymean, Ystd (analysis in PFNN-io-parameter-definition.xls)
* Converted PFNN binary data into JSON files and loaded into HiFi JavaScript.
* Floor markers implemented to provide visual feedback whilst developing (see above)
* PFNN character armature and HiFi armature have a number of structural and naming differences. Quick and dirty re-targetting has been implemented but not yet tested.
* Initialisation functions implemented. Variable values verified by comparing with corresponding C++ output

## Current state 
Currently debugging both C++ and JS versions simultaneously to compare variable values in update function (JS) and pre_render, render and post_render (C++).
Current problem is with implementing C++ mix_directions function in JS:
```c++
static glm::vec3 mix_directions(glm::vec3 x, glm::vec3 y, float a) {
	glm::quat x_q = glm::angleAxis(atan2f(x.x, x.z), glm::vec3(0, 1, 0));
	glm::quat y_q = glm::angleAxis(atan2f(y.x, y.z), glm::vec3(0, 1, 0));
	glm::quat z_q = glm::slerp(x_q, y_q, a);
	return z_q * glm::vec3(0, 0, 1);
}
```

## Setting up environment
Ideally, the C++ project must first be compiled and run so it can be used as a reference. 
Then the JS project is set up for High Fidelity. There are too many PFNN data files to put on GitHub, so the 'pfnn-data' directory must be downloaded from here:
http://davedub.co.uk/downloads/hf/pfnn/pfnn-data.zip
Once downloaded, simply unzip into the same folder as 'ddAnimate.js'. Relative paths are used in the code, so it should work fine.
