# PFNN for High Fidelity

This project is a work in progress - it doesn't work yet. 
The basic idea is to see if the PFNN can be adapted to run in HighFidelity using JavaScript. 
The C++ code is being translated into JavaScript. 
GLM-JS is being used for simpler translation of C++ glm functions.

## Tasks complete:
* Analysed PFNN data files: Xmean, Xstd, Ymean, Ystd (analysis in PFNN-io-parameter-definition.xls)
* Converted PFNN binary data into JSON files and loaded into HiFi JavaScript.
* Floor markers implemented to provide visual feedback whilst developing (see above)
* PFNN character armature and HiFi armature have a number of structural and naming differences. Quick and dirty re-targetting has been implemented but not yet tested.
* Currently working on initialising the Character object (Starting around line 500 of ddAnimate.js). Debugging both C++ and JS versions simultaneouosly to compare variable values. 'pos' and 'vel' values initialising correctly. Currently working on 'rot'. 

## Current task / sticking point:
Attempting to find a JS equivalent for quat_exp (line 1078, demo.cpp, link 2 below). The following code (from line 24 ddAnimate.js) *may* work:

```javascript
quat_exp = function(vectorThree) {
    var w = glm.length(vectorThree);
    var q = w < 0.01 ? 
        glm.quat(1, 0, 0, 0) : 
        glm.quat(
            Math.cos(w),
            vectorThree.x * (Math.sin(w) / w),
            vectorThree.y * (Math.sin(w) / w),
            vectorThree.z * (Math.sin(w) / w)
        );
    return q / Math.sqrt(q.w*q.w + q.x*q.x + q.y*q.y + q.z*q.z);
}
```


## Setting up environment:
Ideally, the C++ project must first be compiled and run so it can be used as a reference. 
Then the JS project is set up for High Fidelity. There are too many PFNN data files to put on GitHub, so the 'pfnn-data' directory must be downloaded from here:
http://davedub.co.uk/downloads/hf/pfnn/pfnn-data.zip
Once downloaded, simply unzip into the same folder as 'ddAnimate.js'. Relative paths are used in the code, so it should work fine.

Apologies for the state of the code - at this early, experimental stage, formatting code to production standard is not a priority.
